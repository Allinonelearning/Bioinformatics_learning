Document the progression of my experience in learning bioinformatics.

# Introduce myself
As a graduate student at Northeast Forestry University and BGI, I am deeply immersed in the fascinating field of bioinformatics. This interdisciplinary area of study perfectly aligns with my passion for both biology and data science, allowing me to explore the intricate connections between biological systems and computational methods. 

My research projects are designed to enhance my understanding of complex biological data and develop my skills in analyzing and interpreting genomic, proteomic, and other “omics” information. 

My research focus is on deciphering plant genomes.
